    <h2>The Siege of Vienna</h2>
        <p>The <b>first siege of Vienna</b> began on September 27, 1529, when Suleiman the Magnificent, Sultan of the Ottoman
           Empire, led an army of at least 100,000 men to capture the city, then ruled by Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria.
           With a force of less than 20,000, the defenders managed to hold off the Ottoman attack.

        Suleiman mustered his forces in Bulgaria, where manpower estimates varied from 100,000 to 300,000
    men, including thousands of Jannisaries, the Sultan's elite personal troops.
    He led these troops across the border through Hungary, facing numerous obstacles
    such as flooding that bogged down their artillery, sickness among the soldiers,
    and resistance from the locals. By the time Suleiman's forces reached Vienna, only 100,000 soldiers remained in good enough 
    condition to maintain the siege.


    <h2 id="The_Siege">The Siege</h2>
        The Ottoman army that made it to Vienna was heavily weakened. A third of them were cavalry units,
        unfit for siege warfare. As the siege went on, supplies and morale ran low, and the Austrians
        launched frequent attacks to disrupt the Ottoman camps. Desertions began to further deplete the Ottoman forces, and
        Suleiman found himself pressured to retreat. He ordered one final assault on October 14, which was beaten back,
        forcing the Ottomans to finally lift the siege and return to Constantinople.
    <h2 id="Aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
        <p>As Suleiman retreated with his forces, they were relentlessly harassed by the enemy. At least 200 Ottomans were killed,
        and several prisoners taken by them were freed, before they crossed the border to Ottoman-controlled lands.
        One high-ranking Ottoman official was reportedly captured on the journey back, though his identity is unknown.</p>
        
        <p>The Ottomans would not attack Vienna again until 1683, a siege which would also fail.</p>
