    <p>My name is Sebastian Duran. I am 24 years old.
    I am From the Dominican Republic, where I was born and raised for 16 years.
    I have lived in the United States since 2017.</p>

    I am an amateur history buff, I love science and technology,
    and I have been trying to learn the basics of computer science for
    about a year now. I'm hoping to have the CompTia A+ certification
    by the end of this year.</p>
