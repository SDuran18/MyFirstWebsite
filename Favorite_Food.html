     <p>Fried Rice is my absolute favorite dish to make. It is delicious, filling, simple to prepare,<br>
    Almost impossible to get wrong, and adjustable for whatever ingredients you have at home.<br> 
    <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/fried-rice-recipe-23652991" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This particular recipe</a> is the one I followed when I first tried my hand<br>
at making fried rice.</p> <!--This is a lie. I did not follow this recipe when I first tried making fried rice.-->
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Rice:</b> Day-old leftover rice is best, to allow it time to firm up and dry. Absent day-old rice, you can try this technique from the recipe:<br>
        <blockquote>spread freshly-cooked rice on a baking pan and let it sit in the freezer for a few hours for a similar effect.</blockquote></li>
    <li><b>Eggs:</b> Very commonly used in fried rice as protein, but not required.</li>
    <li><b>Veggies:</b> You can use any vegetables you have in your kitchen, but this particular recipe recommends <b>diced carrots</b>, <b>peas</b>, <b>scallions</b>, and <b>garlic</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Note:</b> <strong>The proportions of each ingredient are highly customizable to your preference. For the rice in particular, I find that 1 cup makes 2 servings, and adjust accordingly.<br>
    I'll typically make at least 2 cups and enjoy leftovers the next day.</strong></li>
    <li><mark>Optional:</mark>It's not uncommon to add MSG(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>Na) for added flavor, but it's not necessary!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making fried rice</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Stir-fry your veggies:</b> In a large frying pan or wok at high heat, cook all your vegetables first. If frozen, make sure you cook them until they're tender before adding your rice.</li>
    <li><b>Prep your sauce:</b> The original recipe does not call for it until the end, but I personally recommend you prepare your sauce at this point, to add when you start cooking the rice.<br>
    Mix soy sauce, sesame oil, and your choice of seasoning in a small bowl, and set it aside.</li>
    <li><b>Add rice:</b> Once the vegetables are cooked, add your rice and stir it in with the vegetables. At this point, if you chose to prep it beforehand, add your sauce as well.<br>
    I find this makes the rice more flavorful.</li>
    <li><b>Scramble the eggs:</b> Set the rice and vegetables to one side of the pan and throw in your eggs, then mix together. This way, the eggs scramble alongside the rice and spread evenly throughout it.</li>
    <li><b>You're finished!</b> Drizzle with any additional sauce and add your garnish of choice, and you're done. Fried rice really is that simple!</li>
